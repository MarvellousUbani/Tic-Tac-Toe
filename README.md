# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is the third project of the Main Ruby curriculum at Microverse - @microverseinc

#### RULES OF THE GAME

1) The game prompts the two players to enter their name. The first player is assigned "X" and the second player is assigned "O".

2) Once the player names are entered, the command line will prompt each player to enter a position on the board. This position represents the place on the board where that player would like to play. 

3) The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. Each position is represented by an individual number ranging from 1 through 9 as follows:

<p align="center">
|        1       |        2       |        3       |<br>
|        4       |        5       |        6       |<br>
|        7       |        8       |        9       |
</p>

4) Each player will take turns making a move on the board. After each move, the board will be displayed with
  the updated player position. If a value greater than "9" is entered when prompted, the player will be notified
  that this is an invalid move, and they will be asked to enter a valid one (1 - 9).

5) The first player to get 3 positions in a row (up, down, across or diagonally) is the winner.

6) When all 9 positions are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.
